# Prediction of ionic liquids ignition time

Ionic liquids ('green fuels') are fuels recently developed for the space ships and 
aircrafts. They ignite once exposed to open air. Recently new types of them 
having less than 5 milliseconds ignition time were discovered, which was 
the major breakthrough in the 
fuels production industry.


The cost of synthesis of 10 g for any of these molecules exceedes 30,000$.
Therefore, before the synthesis it is crucial to decide whether it is
sensible to synthesize it or it is necessary to redesign the molecule, 
if the ignition time exceeds 5 milliseconds. Fuels with longer 
ignition times are considered old and might not be used in the future.

The aim of this project is to provide the research laboratories that specializes on the 
ionic liquids research work with the tool for the fast assessment 
of the ignition time criteria for 
molecules of interest.
