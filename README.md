# Prediction of ionic liquids ignition time

# Overview 
Ionic liquids ('green fuels') are fuels recently developed for the space ships and aircrafts. They ignite once exposed to open air. Recently new types of them having less than 5 milliseconds ignition time were discovered, which was the major breakthrough in the fuels production industry.


# Motivation
The cost of synthesis of 10 g for any of these molecules exceedes 30,000$. Therefore, before the synthesis it is crucial to decide whether it is sensible to synthesize it or it is necessary to redesign the molecule, if the ignition time exceeds 5 milliseconds. Fuels with longer ignition times are considered old and might not be used in the future.

The aim of this project is to provide the research laboratories that specializes on the ionic liquids research work with the tool for the fast assessment of the ignition time criteria for molecules of interest.




I used the data generated on my own combined with the data 
data I scraped from article as: Z. Zhang, Z. Zhao, B. Wang, J. 
Zhang, Boron Based Hypergolic Ionic Liquids: A Review, 
Green Energy & Environment, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gee.
2020.12.002.

The tool I used for scraping of research journal article was 
Pandas Tabula.
